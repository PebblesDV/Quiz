# Quiz

A quiz I made about powerlifting

The quiz has 8 questions in total, all questions are multiple choice and they all give you 4 options to choose from

After clicking on an answer, you get feedback on whether your answer was correct or wrong. You will also see a button to continue on to the next question

When a button to answer a question has been clicked, the other answer buttons will no longer work when clicked on

After every question the question counter in the right top corner, and the score counter in the left bottom corner will update

After the last question you will see your final score
